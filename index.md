### My view towards computer graphics
   This is my home page of the Computer Graphics(CG) and this is also the first assignment.Important topics in computer graphics include user interface design, sprite graphics, vector graphics, 3D modeling, shaders, GPU design, implicit surface visualization with ray tracing, and computer vision, among others. The overall methodology depends heavily on the underlying sciences of geometry, optics, and physics.So
you may use your creativity in this course.

   The unprecedented development broden the field of CG,VR and AR set up a new approach to information, and screens became thinner and cheaper, put into pockets and in every corner. Cameras are embedded into mobile phones, cars and glasses, supporting video capture and even direct 3D modeling. Moreover, the performance of the video cards have been growing rapidly, cards catering for the calculation of more complex effects.

This is my rencent work of bcp cryptosystem,this is  an Additively Homomorphic Encryption which different from traditional Paillier Homomorphic.It has two mechanisms of decryption.The most important issue is that there is no other codes in github and only one in other website using C++ with poor performance and only one way of decryption.It is writen by myself and the copyright is reserved by cby [my bcp cryptosystem]( https://github.com/cby1996/robot-animation)
